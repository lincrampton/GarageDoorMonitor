July 6

Tried to take a picture:
	pi@raspberry:~ $ raspistill -w 1640 -h 922 -o jul6.jpg
Received:
	mmal: mmal_vc_component_enable: failed to enable component: ENOSPC
	mmal: camera component couldn't be enabled
	mmal: main: Failed to create camera component
	mmal: Failed to run camera app. Please check for firmware updates

First trying enabling camera:
	sudo /usr/bin/raspi-config

Still unsuccessful, so delete automatically running demo:
	ps -elf | grep demo 

Got
	03:26:34 /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/AIY-projects-python/src/examples/vision/joy/joy_detection_demo.py --enable_streaming --mdns_name Vision-Bonnet-0339 --blink_on_error

(this could explain why it is randomly blinking)

Need cron to be regularly running.  

	Check cron status:
		sudo service cron status

	Start cron:
		sudo service cron start

	Possibly reinstall cron:
		sudo apt install cron

Want to make sure joy_detection_demo.py doesn't run on restart, so went to the directory and renamed files.
	pi@raspberry:~/AIY-projects-python/src/examples/vision/joy $ ls -l
